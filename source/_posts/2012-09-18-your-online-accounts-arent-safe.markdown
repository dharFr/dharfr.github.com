Your accounts aren't safe online. That's a fact!
[Linkedin accounts leaked][techcrunch.com], so did [lastfm][lifehacker.com] and probably many others. 
If you still doubt about this, ask Ars Technica on [why passwords have never been weaker][arstechnica.com]. 
Your accounts aren't safe online. Period. 

On the other side, I feel like most Internet users, the ones without a technical background, don't have a clue if theirs accounts are secured or not.
Of course, a lot of them know they must choose a "strong" password (whatever that means), but that's almost all. 

I discussed this topic many times with co-workers or friends. 
There is a few ideas that always came into the conversation:

* People don't care about their online safety. 
* People don't understand all that security shit. 
* The login/password pattern is not a good solution for online authentication.

Here are some of my personal thoughts.

## This is all about education

First of all, I'm pretty sure people do care about their online safety.
It may be true some of them don't understand own online security works.
But I don't think that's the point.
The only thing people need to know is what could be the consequences of poor passwords choices and how to avoid these bad choices.
